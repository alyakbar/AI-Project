If you think of the number 50, you would respond with "L" when the AI guesses 100, "H" when the AI guesses 25, and "C" when the AI guesses 50.
If you think of the number 75, you would respond with "H" when the AI guesses 50, "L" when the AI guesses 100, and "C" when the AI guesses 75.
The AI will continue to guess until it guesses the correct number. "Q" to quit the game.
